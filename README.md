# Predictive-Analytics-for-Customer-Retention

## Overview
  Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses across various industries. It involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company's   product or service in the near future. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and optimize their operations.

## Purpose
  The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. By analyzing historical data and identifying 
  patterns, the model can forecast which customers are at risk of churning. This allows businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and minimize revenue 
  loss.

## Dataset
  The dataset used for this project contains information about past customers, including demographic data, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not. It is 
  divided into two subsets: training data and test data. The training data is used to train the machine learning model, while the test data is used to evaluate its 
  performance.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:

    Clean the data and handle missing values.
    Perform feature engineering to extract relevant features.
    Scale numerical features and encode categorical variables.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    Analyze the distribution of features.
    Identify correlations between variables.
    Visualize patterns and insights in the data.
   
3. Model Selection:

    Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
    Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
    Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
4. Model Evaluation:

    Evaluate the selected model using the test data.
    Calculate performance metrics to assess its effectiveness in predicting churn.
    Generate a confusion matrix and ROC curve to visualize model performance.
